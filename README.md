# AI Time Travel Chat Demo

This is a ‚ö†Ô∏è demo application ‚ö†Ô∏è showcasing how Multiplayer‚Äôs full-stack session recordings work, while you travel through time and chat with historical and fictional figures like Yoda and Pikachu, through an AI-driven dialogue.

During usage, you will encounter intentional errors that will prompt you to send a session recording to Multiplayer for analysis.

You can see a live version of this demo project here: [demo.multiplayer.app](https://demo.multiplayer.app)

## üé• About Multiplayer full-stack session recordings

Multiplayer collects, correlates, and enriches data from the full-stack in a single session-based recording, which includes: frontend screens, device and browser information, user comments, backend logs, correlated distributed traces, requests/responses and header content.

Full-stack session recordings are designed to aid developer workflows (fixing a bug, catching hard-to-reproduce failures, understanding a specific system behaviour, developing a new feature, identifying why a test failed, etc.). They can be used with the Multiplayer MCP server to stream session-based, full-stack, developer annotated recordings to your AI IDEs for more effective prompts.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- Time Travel Conversations - Chat with AI representations of historical and fictional figures from different eras
- Multiplayer Integration - Demonstrates real-time debugging and error reporting capabilities through full-stack session recordings.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

This demo requires Docker and Docker Compose to run locally.

1. Configure environment variables:
   `$ cp .env.example .env`.
   Then, edit the `.env` file to set your desired configuration options (e.g., API keys, service URLs).

2. Start the demo:
   `$ docker-compose up -d`

3. Access the application:
   Navigate to http://localhost:8080 to start exploring the time travel chat experience.

## üß∞ CLI Apps

This repo includes two CLI clients you can run locally to generate sample traffic and full-stack session recordings without the web UI:

- **Node.js CLI**: `clients/nodejs-cli-app` ‚Äî hits the platform services and records a Multiplayer session.
  - See `clients/nodejs-cli-app/README.md` for setup and usage.
- **Python CLI**: `clients/python-cli-app` ‚Äî similar flow implemented in Python.
  - See `clients/python-cli-app/README.md` for setup and usage (uses `uv` for install/run).

## üìö API Endpoints

The demo includes several microservices, each accessible through documentation:
| Service | Endpoint | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Epoch Engine | /v1/epoch-engine/docs | Birth/death dates and biographical data for historical figures |
| Dialogue Hub | /v1/dialogue-hub/docs | AI chat interface for time travel conversations |
| Minds of Time | /v1/minds-of-time/docs | Database of prominent historical figures |
| Vault of Time | /v1/vault-of-time/docs | Historical events and timeline data |
| TimeGate | /v1/timegate/docs | API gateway and service orchestration |

## üß± Services Overview

Quick overview of the services in `services/` and what they do:

- **Envoy** (`services/envoy`) ‚Äî Front proxy routing external traffic to internal services (web app, TimeGate, Dialogue Hub, Epoch Engine, Minds of Time, Vault of Time). Listens on port 8080 by default.
- **TimeGate** (`services/timegate`) ‚Äî Node.js/TypeScript API gateway and orchestrator. Proxies requests to downstream services, exposes REST and WebSocket endpoints, and serves OpenAPI docs at `/v1/timegate/docs`.
- **Dialogue Hub** (`services/dialogue-hub`) ‚Äî Node.js/TypeScript service handling AI chat flows. Integrates with OpenRouter-like LLM APIs; exposes docs at `/v1/dialogue-hub/docs`.
- **Epoch Engine** (`services/epoch-engine`) ‚Äî .NET 8 Web API providing epoch data (historical date ranges, birth/death metadata). Docs at `/v1/epoch-engine/docs`.
- **Minds of Time** (`services/minds-of-time`) ‚Äî Python/Flask API serving data about prominent historical figures. Docs at `/v1/minds-of-time/docs`.
- **Vault of Time** (`services/vault-of-time`) ‚Äî Go HTTP service exposing historical events and timeline data. Docs at `/v1/vault-of-time/docs`.
- **Time Warp** (`services/time-warp`) ‚Äî Java Spring Boot demo app that showcases OpenTelemetry and AI message routing (e.g., to OpenRouter) with context persistence (Redis). Useful for JVM examples.
- **OTel Collector** (`services/otel-collector`) ‚Äî OpenTelemetry Collector configuration for receiving, processing, and exporting telemetry to Multiplayer.

## ü™≤ Demo Usage

This demo is specifically designed to showcase Multiplayer‚Äôs full-stack session recordings.

1. The application starts recording a full-stack session replay as soon as you start your first chat.
2. After a few back and forth messages the application will show an intentional error message, prompting the user to review the full-stack session recording in the Multiplayer web UI (new browser tab).
3. The user can go back to continue chatting in the Time Travel demo app (or start new chats with other historical and fictional figures). The application will continue to stream new data to the original full-stack session recording.

## üìñ Demo Purpose

This application serves as a practical demonstration of:

- AI-powered conversational interfaces
- Historical data integration
- Multiplayer‚Äôs full-stack session recording capabilities
- Microservices architecture

Each API endpoint provides interactive documentation where you can test different features and observe how the system handles various scenarios.

## ‚≠ê Explore Further

Try different conversation scenarios, explore various historical periods, and experience how Multiplayer‚Äôs full-stack session replays enhance the development workflow. The intentional errors you encounter are designed to demonstrate the Multiplayer‚Äôs capabilities in real-world use cases.
